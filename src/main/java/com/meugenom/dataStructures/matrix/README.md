### Matrix

A matrix is a rectangular array of numbers (or other mathematical objects) for which operations such as addition and multiplication are defined.[2] Most commonly, a matrix over a field F is a rectangular array of scalars, each of which is a member of F.[3][4] A real matrix and a complex matrix are matrices whose entries are respectively real numbers or complex numbers. More general types of entries are discussed below. For instance, this is a real matrix:

A = [ −1.3	0.6	20.4	5.5	9.7	−6.2 ].

The numbers, symbols, or expressions in the matrix are called its entries or its elements. The horizontal and vertical lines of entries in a matrix are called rows and columns, respectively.
